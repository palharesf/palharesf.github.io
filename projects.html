                <h2>SG Minesweeper</h2>
                <p><strong>Category:</strong> Web Game | <strong>Status:</strong> Active</p>
                
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>A faithful recreation of the classic Minesweeper game, built entirely with vanilla JavaScript. This project showcases clean code architecture, efficient algorithms, and responsive design principles. The game runs smoothly across all modern browsers and devices without any external dependencies.</p>

                <h3>Key Features</h3>
                <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                    <li>Multiple difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert)</li>
                    <li>Custom board sizes and mine counts</li>
                    <li>First-click safety guarantee</li>
                    <li>Clean, intuitive interface</li>
                    <li>Responsive design for mobile and desktop</li>
                    <li>Efficient flood-fill algorithm for revealing cells</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Technical Highlights</h3>
                <p>The game demonstrates proficiency in DOM manipulation, event handling, and algorithm implementation. The board generation uses a randomization algorithm that ensures fair mine distribution, while the reveal mechanism implements an iterative flood-fill to handle large open areas efficiently.</p>

                <p>Special attention was paid to user experience details: hover effects, visual feedback, and mobile-friendly controls ensure the game feels polished and professional.</p>

                <h2>Userscripts Collection</h2>
                <p><strong>Category:</strong> Browser Extensions | <strong>Status:</strong> Active</p>
                
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>A curated collection of userscripts designed to enhance web browsing experiences across various websites. These scripts add missing functionality, improve interfaces, automate repetitive tasks, and customize websites to better fit individual needs.</p>

                <h3>Philosophy</h3>
                <p>Modern websites often prioritize business goals over user experience. Userscripts give power back to users, allowing them to customize and enhance the websites they use daily. Each script in this collection solves a specific problem or addresses a particular friction point in the browsing experience.</p>

                <h3>Technical Approach</h3>
                <p>All scripts are built with compatibility and maintainability in mind. They use vanilla JavaScript to minimize dependencies, include detailed documentation for easy understanding, and are regularly updated to maintain compatibility with evolving websites.</p>

                <p>The scripts leverage the Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey API to safely inject functionality into pages while respecting security boundaries and following best practices for userscript development.</p>

                <h3>Use Cases</h3>
                <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                    <li>Adding keyboard shortcuts to websites that lack them</li>
                    <li>Removing distracting elements or advertisements</li>
                    <li>Enhancing site navigation and usability</li>
                    <li>Automating repetitive workflows</li>
                    <li>Customizing site appearance and layout</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Project Philosophy</h2>
            <p>All my projects share common principles that reflect my development philosophy. I believe in building things that are genuinely useful, whether that's entertainment through games or productivity through tools. Each project serves a clear purpose and solves a real problem.</p>

            <p>I prioritize code quality and maintainability. Clean, well-documented code isn't just about personal satisfaction - it makes projects easier to maintain, extend, and learn from. Every project includes comprehensive documentation and follows consistent coding standards.</p>

            <p>Finally, I believe in sharing knowledge. All my projects are open source, allowing other developers to learn from my code, suggest improvements, or fork projects for their own use. The programming community has given me so much through open source software and shared knowledge; contributing back is important to me.</p>
