            <h1>About Me</h1>
            
            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>I'm Fernando Palhares, a developer with a passion for building practical, efficient tools that solve real problems. My journey into programming started with curiosity about how things work under the hood, and that curiosity continues to drive my learning and development today.</p>

            <p>I believe in the power of simple, well-crafted code. While modern development often pushes us toward complex frameworks and heavy dependencies, I find satisfaction in building lean, performant applications that do exactly what they need to do - nothing more, nothing less.</p>

            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <p>My primary languages are Python and JavaScript, which together cover a remarkable range of use cases. Python is my go-to for automation, data processing, and backend development. Its clarity and extensive library ecosystem make it perfect for getting things done efficiently.</p>

            <p>JavaScript, on the other hand, is where I bring ideas to life in the browser. Whether it's building interactive web applications, creating browser extensions, or developing userscripts that enhance existing websites, JavaScript gives me the tools to create engaging user experiences.</p>

            <h2>My Approach</h2>
            <p>I'm a strong believer in learning by doing. Each project I undertake teaches me something new, whether it's a clever algorithm, a better way to structure code, or a deeper understanding of how browsers work. I try to document and share these learnings through blog posts and well-commented code.</p>

            <p>When building something, I prioritize:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> The best solution is often the simplest one that works</li>
                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Users shouldn't wait for poorly optimized code</li>
                <li><strong>Readability:</strong> Code is read far more often than it's written</li>
                <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Technical excellence means nothing if users struggle</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Current Focus</h2>
            <p>Right now, I'm focusing on building a collection of practical web applications and tools. My SG Minesweeper project represents my interest in game development and algorithm implementation, while my userscripts collection showcases my dedication to improving everyday web experiences.</p>

            <p>I'm also exploring ways to make my projects more accessible and educational for other developers. Whether through detailed documentation, blog posts explaining my process, or clean, commented source code, I want my work to help others learn and grow as developers.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Code</h2>
            <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading about software architecture and design patterns, and playing logic puzzles and strategy games. These activities often inform my development work, providing new perspectives and problem-solving approaches.</p>

            <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
            <p>I'm always interested in connecting with other developers, discussing projects, or hearing feedback on my work. You can find my projects on GitHub, where I regularly update and maintain my repositories.</p>
            
            <p>Whether you're here to play my games, use my tools, or learn from my code, I hope you find something valuable. Thanks for visiting!</p>
